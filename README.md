# Runaway DnD Simulation

Sometimes life goes crazy and you need to settle a dispute by writing some code.

During one of our sessions we ended up with a scenario in which a Rex Zombie could create a zombie, which when killed, would turn into a Rex Zombie.
The party trapped this runaway chain reaction in a room with some damage spells.

Now, how would this end? Would all the zombies die? Or would this just chain reaction out of control?

Run this code and find out!
